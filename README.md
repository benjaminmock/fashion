# project scope & purpose

This is some test project. I tried to keep it simple, but nevertheless show some techniques and some technologies I like to use. I also used some new libraries like `jest` and [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to have a learning effect for myself.


## requirements

nodejs and npm need to be installed. I had some issues with running the app under macOS sierra. If you run into some strange issues here, consider installing watchman (`brew install watchman`).


## installation
```
npm i
```


## starting the server

```
npm start
```

to set up a node server on port `8000` and a dev server for the frontend on port `3000`. The browser will automatically open `http://localhost:3000` to show the frontend.


## tests

run the test with

```
npm t
```
